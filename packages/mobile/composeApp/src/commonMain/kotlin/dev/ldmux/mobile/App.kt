/**
 * The app, inside one theme.
 *
 * It had no root theme at all. `MaterialTheme` appeared exactly once in this whole
 * package, wrapped around the overflow menu's `DropdownMenu` — so that menu was the
 * only place in the app where a Material default applied, and every other control
 * took `LocalIndication` (and every other Material composition local) from a platform
 * fallback that nothing here chose and nothing here could see. That is the real reason
 * one control felt responsive and the next did not: it was not two treatments, it was
 * one control with Material's ripple and the next with none of Material's anything.
 *
 * It is the same scheme the menu already used, so the menu is unchanged. What changes
 * is that everything is now inside it.
